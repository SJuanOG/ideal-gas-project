# Ideal Gas Project

This is the final project of the course "Fundamentación en computación".

It is a program that uses the Van der Waals, Berthelot and Ideal Gas equations to perform a visual comparison of a gas behavior depending on the Presion, Volume and Temperature coordinates.

In addition it uses the bisection method and the Van der Waals equation to calculate the critical coordinates and print it in the screen.

In orden to run it you need to download it and run it using a local terminal.
